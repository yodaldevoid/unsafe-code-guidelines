<a class="header" href="#interior-mutability" id="interior-mutability"><h4>Interior mutability</h4></a>
<p><em>Interior Mutation</em> means mutating memory where there also exists a live shared reference pointing to the same memory; or mutating memory through a pointer derived from a shared reference.
&quot;live&quot; here means a value that will be &quot;used again&quot; later.
&quot;derived from&quot; means that the pointer was obtained by casting a shared reference and potentially adding an offset.
This is not yet precisely defined, which will be fixed as part of developing a precise aliasing model.</p>
<p>Finding live shared references propagates recursively through references, but not through raw pointers.
So, for example, if data immediately pointed to by a <code>&amp;T</code> or <code>&amp; &amp;mut T</code> is mutated, that's interior mutability.
If data immediately pointed to by a <code>*const T</code> or <code>&amp;*const T</code> is mutated, that's <em>not</em> interior mutability.</p>
<p><em>Interior mutability</em> refers to the ability to perform interior mutation without causing UB.
All interior mutation in Rust has to happen inside an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/cell/struct.UnsafeCell.html"><code>UnsafeCell</code></a>, so all data structures that have interior mutability must (directly or indirectly) use <code>UnsafeCell</code> for this purpose.</p>
<a class="header" href="#validity-and-safety-invariant" id="validity-and-safety-invariant"><h4>Validity and safety invariant</h4></a>
<p>The <em>validity invariant</em> is an invariant that all data must uphold any time it is accessed or copied in a typed manner.
This invariant is known to the compiler and exploited by optimizations such as improved enum layout or eliding in-bounds checks.</p>
<p>In terms of MIR statements, &quot;accessed or copied&quot; means whenever an assignment statement is executed.
That statement has a type (LHS and RHS must have the same type), and the data being assigned must be valid at that type.
Moreover, arguments passed to a function must be valid at the type given in the callee signature, and the return value of a function must be valid at the type given in the caller signature.
OPEN QUESTION: Are there more cases where data must be valid?</p>
<p>In terms of code, some data computed by <code>TERM</code> is valid at type <code>T</code> if and only if the following program does not have UB:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() { unsafe {
  let t: T = std::mem::transmute(TERM);
} }
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>safety</em> invariant is an invariant that safe code may assume all data to uphold.
This invariant is used to justify which operations safe code can perform.
The safety invariant can be temporarily violated by unsafe code, but must always be upheld when interfacing with unknown safe code.
It is not relevant when arguing whether some <em>program</em> has UB, but it is relevant when arguing whether some code safely encapsulates its unsafety -- IOW, it is relevant when arguing whether some <em>library</em> can be used by safe code to <em>cause</em> UB.</p>
<p>In terms of code, some data computed by <code>TERM</code> (possibly constructed from some <code>arguments</code> that can be <em>assumed</em> to satisfy the safety invariant) is valid at type <code>T</code> if and only if the following library function can be safely exposed to arbitrary (safe) code as part of the public library interface:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn make_something(arguments: U) -&gt; T { unsafe {
  std::mem::transmute(TERM)
} }
</code></pre>
<p>One example of valid-but-unsafe data is a <code>&amp;str</code> or <code>String</code> that's not well-formed UTF-8: the compiler will not run its own optimizations that would cause any trouble here, so unsafe code may temporarily violate the invariant that strings are <code>UTF-8</code>.
However, functions on <code>&amp;str</code>/<code>String</code> may assume the string to be <code>UTF-8</code>, meaning they may cause UB if the string is <em>not</em> <code>UTF-8</code>.
This means that unsafe code violating the UTF-8 invariant must not perform string operations (it may operate on the data as a byte slice though), or else it risks UB.
Moreover, such unsafe code must not return a non-UTF-8 string to the &quot;outside&quot; of its safe abstraction boundary, because that would mean safe code could cause UB by doing <code>bad_function().chars().count()</code>.</p>
<p>To summarize: <em>Data must always be valid, but it only must be safe in safe code.</em>

<a class="header" href="#layout" id="layout"><h4>Layout</h4></a>
<p>The <em>layout</em> of a type defines its size and alignment as well as the offsets of its subobjects (e.g. fields of structs/unions/enum/... or elements of arrays).
Moreover, the layout of a type records its <em>function call ABI</em> (or just <em>ABI</em> for short): how the type is passed <em>by value</em> across a function boundary.</p>
<p>Note: Originally, <em>layout</em> and <em>representation</em> were treated as synonyms, and Rust language features like the <code>#[repr]</code> attribute reflect this.
In this document, <em>layout</em> and <em>representation</em> are not synonyms.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This chapter represents the consensus from issues
<a href="https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/11">#11</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/12">#12</a>.  The statements in here are not (yet) &quot;guaranteed&quot;
not to change until an RFC ratifies them.</p>
<a class="header" href="#tuple-types" id="tuple-types"><h2>Tuple types</h2></a>
<p>In general, an anonymous tuple type <code>(T1..Tn)</code> of arity N is laid out
&quot;as if&quot; there were a corresponding tuple struct declared in libcore:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[repr(Rust)]
struct TupleN&lt;P1..Pn:?Sized&gt;(P1..Pn);
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>(T1..Tn)</code> would be compatible with <code>TupleN&lt;T1..Tn&gt;</code>.
As discussed below, this generally means that the compiler is <strong>free
to re-order field layout</strong> as it wishes. Thus, if you would like a
guaranteed layout from a tuple, you are generally advised to create a
named struct with a <code>#[repr(C)]</code> annotation (see <a href="#structs">the section on
structs for more details</a>).</p>
<p>Note that the final element of a tuple (<code>Pn</code>) is marked as <code>?Sized</code> to
permit unsized tuple coercion -- this is implemented on nightly but is
currently unstable (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/42877">tracking issue</a>). In the future, we may
extend unsizing to other elements of tuples as well.</p>
<a class="header" href="#other-notes-on-tuples" id="other-notes-on-tuples"><h3>Other notes on tuples</h3></a>
<p>Some related discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1582">RFC #1582</a> proposed
that tuple structs should have a &quot;nested layout&quot;, where
e.g. <code>(T1, T2, T3)</code> would in fact be laid out as <code>(T1, (T2, T3))</code>. The purpose of this was to permit variadic matching and so
forth against some suffix of the struct. This RFC was not accepted,
however. This layout requires extra padding and seems somewhat
surprising: it means that the layout of tuples and tuple structs
would diverge significantly from structs with named fields.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="structs"></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#struct-types" id="struct-types"><h2>Struct types</h2></a>
<p>Structs come in two principle varieties:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// Structs with named fields
struct Foo { f1: T1, .., fn: Tn }

// Tuple structs
struct Foo(T1, .., Tn);
</code></pre>
<p>In terms of their layout, tuple structs can be understood as
equivalent to a named struct with fields named <code>0..n-1</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Foo {
  0: T1,
  ...
  n-1: Tn
}
</code></pre>
<p>(In fact, one may use such field names in patterns or in accessor
expressions like <code>foo.0</code>.)</p>
<p>Structs can have various <code>#[repr]</code> flags that influence their layout:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#[repr(Rust)]</code> -- the default.</li>
<li><code>#[repr(C)]</code> -- request C compatibility</li>
<li><code>#[repr(align(N))]</code> -- specify the alignment</li>
<li><code>#[repr(packed)]</code> -- request packed layout where fields are not internally aligned</li>
<li><code>#[repr(transparent)]</code> -- request that a &quot;wrapper struct&quot; be treated
&quot;as if&quot; it were an instance of its field type when passed as an
argument</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#default-layout-repr-rust" id="default-layout-repr-rust"><h3>Default layout (&quot;repr rust&quot;)</h3></a>
<p><strong>The default layout of structs is not specified.</strong> As of this
writing, we have not reached a full consensus on what limitations
should exist on possible field struct layouts, so effectively one must
assume that the compiler can select any layout it likes for each
struct on each compilation, and it is not required to select the same
layout across two compilations. This implies that (among other things)
two structs with the same field types may not be laid out in the same
way (for example, the hypothetical struct representing tuples may be
laid out differently from user-declared structs).</p>
<p>Known things that can influence layout (non-exhaustive):</p>
<ul>
<li>the type of the struct fields and the layout of those types</li>
<li>compiler settings, including esoteric choices like optimization fuel</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A note on determinism.</strong> The definition above does not guarantee
determinism between executions of the compiler -- two executions may
select different layouts, even if all inputs are identical. Naturally,
in practice, the compiler aims to produce deterministic output for a
given set of inputs. However, it is difficult to produce a
comprehensive summary of the various factors that may affect the
layout of structs, and so for the time being we have opted for a
conservative definition.</p>
<p><strong>Compiler's current behavior.</strong> As of the time of this writing, the
compiler will reorder struct fields to minimize the overall size of
the struct (and in particular to eliminate padding due to alignment
restrictions).</p>
<p>Layout is presently defined not in terms of a &quot;fully monomorphized&quot;
struct definition but rather in terms of its generic definition along
with a set of substitutions (values for each type parameter; lifetime
parameters do not affect layout). This distinction is important
because of <em>unsizing</em> -- if the final field has generic type, the
compiler will not reorder it, to allow for the possibility of
unsizing. E.g., <code>struct Foo { x: u16, y: u32 }</code> and <code>struct Foo&lt;T&gt; { x: u16, y: T }</code> where <code>T = u32</code> are not guaranteed to be identical.</p>
<a class="header" href="#unresolved-questions" id="unresolved-questions"><h4>Unresolved questions</h4></a>
<p>During the course of the discussion in <a href="https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/11">#11</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/12">#12</a>, various
suggestions arose to limit the compiler's flexibility. These questions
are currently considering <strong>unresolved</strong> and -- for each of them -- an
issue has been opened for further discussion on the repository. This
section documents the questions and gives a few light details, but the
reader is referred to the issues for further discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-sized structs (<a href="https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/37">#37</a>).</strong> If you have a struct which --
transitively -- contains no data of non-zero size, then the size of
that struct will be zero as well. These zero-sized structs appear
frequently as exceptions in other layout considerations (e.g.,
single-field structs). An example of such a struct is
<code>std::marker::PhantomData</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Single-field structs (<a href="https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/34">#34</a>).</strong> If you have a struct with single field
(<code>struct Foo { x: T }</code>), should we guarantee that the memory layout of
<code>Foo</code> is identical to the memory layout of <code>T</code> (note that ABI details
around function calls may still draw a distinction, which is why
<code>#[repr(transparent)]</code> is needed). What about zero-sized types like
<code>PhantomData</code>?</p>
<p><strong>Homogeneous structs (<a href="https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/36">#36</a>).</strong> If you have homogeneous structs, where all
the <code>N</code> fields are of a single type <code>T</code>, can we guarantee a mapping to
the memory layout of <code>[T; N]</code>? How do we map between the field names
and the indices? What about zero-sized types?</p>
<p><strong>Deterministic layout (<a href="https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/35">#35</a>).</strong> Can we say that layout is some deterministic
function of a certain, fixed set of inputs? This would allow you to be
sure that if you do not alter those inputs, your struct layout would
not change, even if it meant that you can't predict precisely what it
will be. For example, we might say that struct layout is a function of
the struct's generic types and its substitutions, full stop -- this
would imply that any two structs with the same definition are laid out
the same. This might interfere with our ability to do profile-guided
layout or to analyze how a struct is used and optimize based on
that. Some would call that a feature.</p>
<a class="header" href="#c-compatible-layout-repr-c" id="c-compatible-layout-repr-c"><h3>C-compatible layout (&quot;repr C&quot;)</h3></a>
<p>For structs tagged <code>#[repr(C)]</code>, the compiler will apply a C-like
layout scheme. See section 6.7.2.1 of the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/abq/c17_updated_proposed_fdis.pdf">C17 specification</a> for
a detailed write-up of what such rules entail (as well as the relevant
specs for your platform). For most platforms, however, this means the
following:</p>
<ul>

<p>The intention is that if one has a set of C struct declarations and a
corresponding set of Rust struct declarations, all of which are tagged
with <code>#[repr(C)]</code>, then the layout of those structs will all be
identical. Note that this setup implies that none of the structs in
question can contain any <code>#[repr(Rust)]</code> structs (or Rust tuples), as
those would have no corresponding C struct declaration -- as
<code>#[repr(Rust)]</code> types have undefined layout, you cannot safely declare
their layout in a C program.</p>
<p>See also the notes on <a href="#fnabi">ABI compatibility</a> under the section on <code>#[repr(transparent)]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Structs with no fields.</strong> One area where Rust layout can deviate
from C/C++ -- even with <code>#[repr(C)]</code> -- comes about with &quot;empty
structs&quot; that have no fields. In C, an empty struct declaration like
<code>struct Foo { }</code> is illegal. However, both gcc and clang support
options to enable such structs, and <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/AS2gdC">assign them size
zero</a>. Rust behaves the same way --
empty structs have size 0 and alignment 1 (unless an explicit
<code>#[repr(align)]</code> is present). C++, in contrast, gives empty structs a
size of 1, unless they are inherited from or they are fields that have
the <code>[[no_unique_address]]</code> attribute, in which case they do not
increase the overall size of the struct.</p>
<p><strong>Structs of zero-size.</strong> It is also possible to have structs that
have fields but still have zero size. In this case, the size of the
struct would be zero, but its alignment may be greater. For example,
<code>#[repr(C)] struct Foo { x: [u16; 0] }</code> would have an alignment of 2
bytes by default. (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5w0gkq">This matches the behavior in gcc and
clang</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Structs with fields of zero-size.</strong> If a <code>#[repr(C)]</code> struct
containing a field of zero-size, that field does not occupy space in
the struct; it can affect the offsets of subsequent fields if it
induces padding due to the alignment on its type. (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5w0gkq">This matches the
behavior in gcc and clang</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>C++ compatibility hazard.</strong> As noted above when discussing structs
with no fields, C++ treats empty structs like <code>struct Foo { }</code>
differently from C and Rust. This can introduce subtle compatibility
hazards. If you have an empty struct in your C++ code and you make the
&quot;naive&quot; translation into Rust, even tagging with <code>#[repr(C)]</code> will not
produce layout- or ABI-compatible results.</p>
<a class="header" href="#fixed-alignment" id="fixed-alignment"><h3>Fixed alignment</h3></a>
<p>The <code>#[repr(align(N))]</code> attribute may be used to raise the alignment
of a struct, as described in <a href="(https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/type-layout.html#the-align-representation).">The Rust Reference</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#packed-layout" id="packed-layout"><h3>Packed layout</h3></a>
<p>The <code>#[repr(packed(N))]</code> attribute may be used to impose a maximum
limit on the alignments for individual fields. It is most commonly
used with an alignment of 1, which makes the struct as small as
possible. For example, in a <code>#[repr(packed(2))]</code> struct, a <code>u8</code> or
<code>u16</code> would be aligned at 1- or 2-bytes respectively (as normal), but
a <code>u32</code> would be aligned at only 2 bytes instead of 4. In the absence
of an explicit <code>#[repr(align)]</code> directive, <code>#[repr(packed(N))]</code> also
sets the alignment for the struct as a whole to N bytes.</p>
<p>The resulting fields may not fall at properly aligned boundaries in
memory. This makes it unsafe to create a Rust reference (<code>&amp;T</code> or <code>&amp;mut T</code>) to those fields, as the compiler requires that all reference
values must always be aligned (so that it can use more efficient
load/store instructions at runtime). See the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/type-layout.html#the-packed-representation">Rust reference for more
details</a>.</p>

<a class="header" href="#function-call-abi-compatibility" id="function-call-abi-compatibility"><h3>Function call ABI compatibility</h3></a>
<p>In general, when invoking functions that use the C ABI, <code>#[repr(C)]</code>
structs are guaranteed to be passed in the same way as their
corresponding C counterpart (presuming one exists). <code>#[repr(Rust)]</code>
structs have no such guarantee. This means that if you have an <code>extern &quot;C&quot;</code> function, you cannot pass a <code>#[repr(Rust)]</code> struct as one of its
arguments. Instead, one would typically pass <code>#[repr(C)]</code> structs (or
possibly pointers to Rust-structs, if those structs are opaque on the
other side, or the callee is defined in Rust).</p>
<p>However, there is a subtle point about C ABIs: in some C ABIs, passing
a struct with one field of type <code>T</code> as an argument is <strong>not</strong>
equivalent to just passing a value of type <code>T</code>. So e.g. if you have a
C function that is defined to take a <code>uint32_t</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-C">void some_function(uint32_t value) { .. }
</code></pre>
<p>It is <strong>incorrect</strong> to pass in a struct as that value, even if that
struct is <code>#[repr(C)</code>] and has only one field:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[repr(C)]
struct Foo { x: u32 }

extern &quot;C&quot; some_function(Foo);

some_function(Foo { x: 22 }); // Bad!
</code></pre>
<p>Instead, you should declare the struct with <code>#[repr(transparent)]</code>,
which specifies that <code>Foo</code> should use the ABI rules for its field
type, <code>u32</code>. This is useful when using &quot;wrapper structs&quot; in Rust to
give stronger typing guarantees.</p>
<p><code>#[repr(transparent)]</code> can only be applied to structs with a single
field whose type <code>T</code> has non-zero size, along with some number of
other fields whose types are all zero-sized (typically
<code>std::marker::PhantomData</code> fields). The struct then takes on the &quot;ABI
behavior&quot; of the type <code>T</code> that has non-zero size.</p>
<p>(Note further that the Rust ABI is undefined and theoretically may
vary from compiler revision to compiler revision.)</p>
<a class="header" href="#unresolved-question-guaranteeing-compatible-layouts" id="unresolved-question-guaranteeing-compatible-layouts"><h2>Unresolved question: Guaranteeing compatible layouts?</h2></a>
<p>One key unresolved question was whether we would want to guarantee
that two <code>#[repr(Rust)]</code> structs whose fields have the same types are
laid out in a &quot;compatible&quot; way, such that one could be transmuted to
the other. @rkruppe laid out a <a href="https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/11#issuecomment-419956939">number of
examples</a>
where this might be a reasonable thing to expect. As currently
written, and in an effort to be conservative, we make no such
guarantee, though we do not firmly rule out doing such a thing in the future.</p>
<p>It seems like it may well be desirable to -- at minimum -- guarantee
that <code>#[repr(Rust)]</code> layout is &quot;some deterministic function of the
struct declaration and the monomorphized types of its fields&quot;.  Note
that it is not sufficient to consider the monomorphized type of a
struct's fields: due to unsizing coercions, it matters whether the
struct is declared in a generic way or not, since the &quot;unsized&quot; field
must presently be <a href="https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/12#issuecomment-417843595">laid out last in the
structure</a>. (Note
that tuples are always coercible (see <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/42877">#42877</a> for more information),
and are always declared as generics.) This implies that our
&quot;deterministic function&quot; also takes as input the form in which the
fields are declared in the struct.</p>
<p>However, that rule is not true today. For example, the compiler
includes an option (called &quot;optimization fuel&quot;) that will enable us to
alter the layout of only the &quot;first N&quot; structs declared in the
source. When one is accidentally relying on the layout of a structure,
this can be used to track down the struct that is causing the problem.</p>
<p>There are also benefits to having fewer guarantees. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code hardening tools can be used to randomize the layout of individual structs.</li>
<li>Profile-guided optimization might analyze how instances of a
particular struct are used and tweak the layout (e.g., to insert
padding and reduce false sharing).
<ul>
<li>However, there aren't many tools that do this sort of thing
(<a href="https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/11#issuecomment-420650851">1</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/11#issuecomment-420681763">2</a>). Moreover,
it would probably be better for the tools to merely recommend
annotations that could be added
(<a href="https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/11#issuecomment-420077105">1</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/11#issuecomment-420077105">2</a>),
such that the knowledge of the improved layouts can be recorded in the
source.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a more declarative alternative, @alercah <a href="https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/12#issuecomment-420165155">proposed a possible
extension</a>
that would permit one to declare that the layout of two structs or
types are compatible (e.g., <code>#[repr(as(Foo))] struct Bar { .. }</code>),
thus permitting safe transmutes (and also ABI compatibility).  One
might also use some weaker form of <code>#[repr(C)]</code> to specify a &quot;more
deterministic&quot; layout. These areas need future exploration.</p>

suggesting instead it would be better if users reordering fields

<ul>
<li>In a generic struct, the <a href="https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/11#issuecomment-420659840">best ordering of fields may not be known

<li>If layout is defined, and a library exposes a struct with all public

on this assumption, that would break if fields were reordered. But
libraries may well expect the freedom to reorder fields. This case
is weakened because of the requirement to write unsafe code (after
all, one can always write unsafe code that relies on virtually any
implementation detail); if we were to permit <strong>safe</strong> casts that
rely on the layout, then reordering fields would clearly be a
breaking change (see also <a href="https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/11#issuecomment-420117856">this

<a class="header" href="#categories-of-enums" id="categories-of-enums"><h2>Categories of enums</h2></a>
<p><strong>Empty enums.</strong> Enums with no variants can never be instantiated and
are equivalent to the <code>!</code> type. They do not accept any <code>#[repr]</code>
annotations.</p>
<p><strong>Fieldless enums.</strong> The simplest form of enum is one where none of
the variants have any fields:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
enum SomeEnum {
  Variant1,
  Variant2,
  Variant3,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Such enums correspond quite closely with enums in the C language
(though there are important differences as well). Presuming that they
have more than one variant, these sorts of enums are always
represented as a simple integer, though the size will vary.</p>
<p>Fieldless enums may also specify the value of their discriminants
explicitly:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
enum SomeEnum {
  Variant22 = 22,
  Variant44 = 44,
  Variant45,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>As in C, discriminant values that are not specified are defined as
either 0 (for the first variant) or as one more than the prior
variant.</p>
<p><strong>Data-carrying enums.</strong> Enums whose variants have fields are called
&quot;data-carrying&quot; enums. Note that for the purposes of this definition,
it is not relevant whether those fields are zero-sized. Therefore this
enum is considered &quot;data-carrying&quot;:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
enum Foo {
  Bar(()),
  Baz,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="#repr-annotations-accepted-on-enums" id="repr-annotations-accepted-on-enums"><h2>repr annotations accepted on enums</h2></a>
<p>In general, enums may be annotated using the following <code>#[repr]</code> tags:</p>
<ul>
<li>A specific integer type (called <code>Int</code> as a shorthand below):
<ul>
<li><code>#[repr(u8)]</code></li>
<li><code>#[repr(u16)]</code></li>
<li><code>#[repr(u32)]</code></li>
<li><code>#[repr(u64)]</code></li>
<li><code>#[repr(i8)]</code></li>
<li><code>#[repr(i16)]</code></li>
<li><code>#[repr(i32)]</code></li>
<li><code>#[repr(i64)]</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>C-compatible layout:
<ul>
<li><code>#[repr(C)]</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>C-compatible layout with a specified discriminant size:
<ul>
<li><code>#[repr(C, u8)]</code></li>
<li><code>#[repr(C, u16)]</code></li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that manually specifying the alignment using <code>#[repr(align)]</code> is
not permitted on an enum.</p>
<p>The set of repr annotations accepted by an enum depends on its category,
as defined above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Empty enums: no repr annotations are permitted.</li>
<li>Fieldless enums: <code>#[repr(Int)]</code>-style and <code>#[repr(C)]</code> annotations are permitted, but <code>#[repr(C, Int)]</code> annotations are not.</li>
<li>Data-carrying enums: all repr annotations are permitted.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#enum-layout-rules" id="enum-layout-rules"><h2>Enum layout rules</h2></a>
<p>The rules for enum layout vary depending on the category.</p>
<a class="header" href="#layout-of-an-empty-enum" id="layout-of-an-empty-enum"><h3>Layout of an empty enum</h3></a>
<p>An <strong>empty enum</strong> is an enum with no variants; empty enums can never
be instantiated and are logically equivalent to the &quot;never type&quot;
<code>!</code>. <code>#[repr]</code> annotations are not accepted on empty enums. Empty
enums are guaranteed to have the same layout as <code>!</code> (zero size and
alignment 1).</p>
<a class="header" href="#layout-of-a-fieldless-enum" id="layout-of-a-fieldless-enum"><h3>Layout of a fieldless enum</h3></a>
<p>If there is no <code>#[repr]</code> attached to a fieldless enum, the compiler
will represent it using an integer of sufficient size to store the
discriminants for all possible variants -- note that if there is only
one variant, then 0 bits are required, so it is possible that the enum
may have zero size. In the absence of a <code>#[repr]</code> annotation, the
number of bits used by the compiler are not defined and are subject to
change.</p>
<p>When a <code>#[repr(Int)]</code>-style annotation is attached to a fieldless enum
(one without any data for its variants), it will cause the enum to be
represented as a simple integer of the specified size <code>Int</code>. This must
be sufficient to store all the required discriminant values.</p>
<p>The <code>#[repr(C)]</code> annotation is equivalent, but it selects the same
size as the C compiler would use for the given target for an
equivalent C-enum declaration.</p>
<p>Combining a <code>C</code> and <code>Int</code> <code>repr</code> (e.g., <code>#[repr(C, u8)]</code>) is
not permitted on a fieldless enum.</p>
<p>The values used for the discriminant will match up with what is
specified (or automatically assigned) in the enum definition. For
example, the following enum defines the discriminants for its variants
as 22 and 23 respectively:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
enum Foo { 
  // Specificy discriminant of this variant as 22:
  Variant22 = 22,
  
  // Default discriminant is one more than the previous,
  // so 23 will be assigned.
  Variant23
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> some C compilers offer flags (e.g., <code>-fshort-enums</code>) that
change the layout of enums from the default settings that are standard
for the platform. The integer size selected by <code>#[repr(C)]</code> is defined
to match the <strong>default</strong> settings for a given target, when no such
flags are supplied. If interop with code that uses other flags is
desired, then one should either specify the sizes of enums manually or
else use an alternate target definition that is tailored to the
compiler flags in use.</p>

series of <code>#[repr(C)]</code> structs, one per variant. Each of these structs
begins with an integral field containing the <strong>discriminant</strong>, which
specifies which variant is active. They then contain the remaining
fields associated with that variant.</p>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> The following enum uses an <code>repr(u8)</code> annotation:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[repr(u8)]
enum TwoCases {
    A(u8, u16),
    B(u16),
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This will be laid out equivalently to the following more
complex Rust types:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[repr(C)]
union TwoCasesRepr {
    A: TwoCasesVariantA,
    B: TwoCasesVariantB,
}
        
# #[derive(Copy, Clone)]        
#[repr(u8)]
enum TwoCasesTag { A, B }

# #[derive(Copy, Clone)]
#[repr(C)]
struct TwoCasesVariantA(TwoCasesTag, u8, u16);

# #[derive(Copy, Clone)]
#[repr(C)]
struct TwoCasesVariantB(TwoCasesTag, u16);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>TwoCasesVariantA</code> and <code>TwoCasesVariantB</code> structs are
<code>#[repr(C)]</code>; this is needed to ensure that the <code>TwoCasesTag</code> value
appears at offset 0 in both cases, so that we can read it to determine
the current variant.</p>
<a class="header" href="#explicit-repr-annotation-with-c-compatibility" id="explicit-repr-annotation-with-c-compatibility"><h4>Explicit repr annotation with C compatibility</h4></a>
<p>When the <code>#[repr]</code> tag includes <code>C</code>, e.g., <code>#[repr(C)]</code> or <code>#[repr(C, u8)]</code>, the layout of enums is changed to better match C++ enums. In
this mode, the data is laid out as a tuple of <code>(discriminant, union)</code>,
where <code>union</code> represents a C union of all the possible variants. The
type of the discriminant will be the integral type specified (<code>u8</code>,
etc) -- if no type is specified, then the compiler will select one
based on what a size a fieldless enum would have with the same number of
variants.</p>
<p>This layout, while more compatible and arguably more obvious, is also
less efficient than the non-C compatible layout in some cases in terms
of total size. For example, the <code>TwoCases</code> example given in the
preivous section only occupies 4 bytes with <code>#[repr(u8)]</code>, but would
occupy 6 bytes with <code>#[repr(C, u8)]</code>, as more padding is required.</p>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> The following enum:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[repr(C, Int)]
enum MyEnum {
    A(u32),
    B(f32, u64),
    C { x: u32, y: u8 },
    D,
}
</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to the following Rust definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[repr(C)]
struct MyEnumRepr {
    tag: MyEnumTag,
    payload: MyEnumPayload,
}

#[repr(Int)]
enum MyEnumTag { A, B, C, D }

#[repr(C)]
union MyEnumPayload {
   A: u32,
   B: MyEnumPayloadB,
   C: MyEnumPayloadC,
   D: (),
}

#[repr(C)]
struct MyEnumPayloadB(f32, u64);

#[repr(C)]
struct MyEnumPayloadC { x: u32, y: u8 }
</code></pre>
<p>This enum can also be represented in C++ as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c++">#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

enum class MyEnumTag: CppEquivalentOfInt { A, B, C, D };
struct MyEnumPayloadB { float _0; uint64_t _1;  };
struct MyEnumPayloadC { uint32_t x; uint8_t y; };

union MyEnumPayload {
   uint32_t A;
   MyEnumPayloadB B;
   MyEnumPayloadC C;
};

struct MyEnum {
    MyEnumTag tag;
    MyEnumPayload payload;
};

<p>If no explicit <code>#[repr]</code> attribute is used, then the layout of a

apply, as described below.</p>
<a class="header" href="#discriminant-elision-on-option-like-enums" id="discriminant-elision-on-option-like-enums"><h4>Discriminant elision on Option-like enums</h4></a>
<p>(Meta-note: The content in this section is not described by any RFC
and is therefore &quot;non-normative&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> An <strong>option-like enum</strong> is a 2-variant enum where:</p>
<ul>
<li>one variant has a single field, and</li>
<li>the other variant has no fields (the &quot;unit variant&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest example is <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> itself, where the <code>Some</code> variant
has a single field (of type <code>T</code>), and the <code>None</code> variant has no
fields. But other enums that fit that same template fit.</p>
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> The <strong>payload</strong> of an option-like enum is the single
field which it contains; in the case of <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, the payload has
type <code>T</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> In some cases, the payload type may contain illegal
values, which are called <strong>niches</strong>. For example, a value of type <code>&amp;T</code>
may never be <code>NULL</code>, and hence defines a niche consisting of the
bitstring <code>0</code>.  Similarly, the standard library types <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/num/struct.NonZeroU8.html"><code>NonZeroU8</code></a>
and friends may never be zero, and hence also define the value of <code>0</code>
as a niche. (Types that define niche values will say so as part of the
description of their validity invariant, which -- as of this writing
-- are the next topic up for discussion in the unsafe code guidelines
process.)</p>
<p><strong>Option-like enums where the payload defines at least one niche value
are guaranteed to be represented using the same memory layout as their
payload.</strong> This is called <strong>discriminant elision</strong>, as there is no
explicit discriminant value stored anywhere. Instead, niche values are
used to represent the unit variant.</p>
<p>The most common example is that <code>Option&lt;&amp;u8&gt;</code> can be represented as an
nullable <code>&amp;u8</code> reference -- the <code>None</code> variant is then represented
using the niche value zero. This is because a valid <code>&amp;u8</code> value can
never be zero, so if we see a zero value, we know that this must be
<code>None</code> variant.</p>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> The type <code>Option&lt;&amp;u32&gt;</code> will be represented at runtime as
a nullable pointer. FFI interop often depends on this property.</p>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> As <code>fn</code> types are non-nullable, the type <code>Option&lt;extern &quot;C&quot; fn()&gt;</code> will be represented at runtime as a nullable function
pointer (which is therefore equivalent to a C function pointer) . FFI
interop often depends on this property.</p>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> The following enum definition is <strong>not</strong> option-like,
as it has two unit variants:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
enum Enum1&lt;T&gt; {
  Present(T),
  Absent1,
  Absent2,
}

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/79">Issue #79.</a></p>
<p>Enums that contain a <strong>single variant</strong> and which do not have an
explicit <code>#[repr]</code> annotation are an important special case. Since
there is only a single variant, the enum must be instantiated with
that variant, which means that the enum is in fact equivalent to a
struct. The question then is to what extent we should <strong>guarantee</strong>
that the two share an equivalent layout, and also how to define the
interaction with uninhabited types.</p>
<p>As presently implemented, the compiler will use the same layout for
structs and for single variant enums (as long as they do not have a
<code>#[repr]</code> annotation that overrides that choice). So, for example, the
struct <code>SomeStruct</code> and the enum <code>SomeEnum</code> would have an equivalent
layout (<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=3697ac684c3d021892694956df957653">playground</a>):</p>

# }
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Similarly, the struct <code>SomeStruct</code> and the enum <code>SomeVariant</code> in this
example would also be equivalent in their layout
(<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=924724764419f846c788a8763da45992">playground</a>):</p>

<p>The only degree of freedom the compiler has when computing the layout of a union

<p>is to determine the offset of the fields.  The layout of these fields themselves
is already entirely determined by their types, and since we intend to allow
creating references to fields (<code>&amp;u.f1</code>), unions do not have any wiggle-room
there.</p>

<a class="header" href="#terminology-1" id="terminology-1"><h3>Terminology</h3></a>
<p>In Rust, a function pointer type, is either <code>fn(Args...) -&gt; Ret</code>,
<code>extern &quot;ABI&quot; fn(Args...) -&gt; Ret</code>, <code>unsafe fn(Args...) -&gt; Ret</code>, and
<code>unsafe extern &quot;ABI&quot; fn(Args...) -&gt; Ret</code>.
A function pointer is the address of a function,
and has function pointer type.
The pointer is implicit in the <code>fn</code> type,
and they have no lifetime of their own;
therefore, function pointers are assumed to point to
a block of code with static lifetime.
This is not necessarily always true,
since, for example, you can unload a dynamic library.
Therefore, this is <em>only</em> a safety invariant,
not a validity invariant;
as long as one doesn't call a function pointer which points to freed memory,
it is not undefined behavior.</p>
<p>In C, a function pointer type is <code>Ret (*)(Args...)</code>, or <code>Ret ABI (*)(Args...)</code>,
and values of function pointer type are either a null pointer value,
or the address of a function.</p>
<a class="header" href="#representation-1" id="representation-1"><h3>Representation</h3></a>
<p>The ABI and layout of <code>(unsafe)? (extern &quot;ABI&quot;)? fn(Args...) -&gt; Ret</code>
is exactly that of the corresonding C type --
the lack of a null value does not change this.
On common platforms, this means that <code>*const ()</code> and <code>fn(Args...) -&gt; Ret</code> have
the same ABI and layout. This is, in fact, guaranteed by POSIX and Windows.
This means that for the vast majority of platforms,</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn go_through_pointer(x: fn()) -&gt; fn() {
  let ptr = x as *const ();
  unsafe { std::mem::transmute::&lt;*const (), fn()&gt;(ptr) }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>is both perfectly safe, and, in fact, required for some APIs -- notably,
<code>GetProcAddress</code> on Windows requires you to convert from <code>void (*)()</code> to
<code>void*</code>, to get the address of a variable;
and the opposite is true of <code>dlsym</code>, which requires you to convert from
<code>void*</code> to <code>void (*)()</code> in order to get the address of functions.
This conversion is <em>not</em> guaranteed by Rust itself, however;
simply the implementation. If the underlying platform allows this conversion,
so will Rust.</p>
<p>However, null values are not supported by the Rust function pointer types --
just like references, the expectation is that you use <code>Option</code> to create
nullable pointers. <code>Option&lt;fn(Args...) -&gt; Ret&gt;</code> will have the exact same ABI
as <code>fn(Args...) -&gt; Ret</code>, but additionally allows null pointer values.</p>
<a class="header" href="#use" id="use"><h3>Use</h3></a>
<p>Function pointers are mostly useful for talking to C -- in Rust, you would
mostly use <code>T: Fn()</code> instead of <code>fn()</code>. If talking to a C API,
the same caveats as apply to other FFI code should be followed.
As an example, we shall implement the following C interface in Rust:</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: the type of array arguments in C function signatures, e.g., <code>void foo(T x[N])</code>, decays to a pointer. That is, these functions do not take arrays

instead. Array types are therefore <em>improper C types</em> (not C FFI safe) in Rust
foreign function declarations, e.g., <code>extern { fn foo(x: [T; N]) -&gt; [U; M]; }</code>. Pointers to arrays are fine: <code>extern { fn foo(x: *const [T; N]) -&gt; *const [U; M]; }</code>, and <code>struct</code>s and <code>union</code>s containing arrays are also fine.</p>

<p>Currently, the <a href="layout/./structs-and-tuples.html">layout of structs and tuples</a> does not guarantee that the
element <em>size</em> is a multiple of its <em>alignment</em>. For example, consider:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct A(u16, u8);
type B = [A; 4];
</code></pre>
<p>In the current Rust implementation, <code>A</code> has an alignment and a size of <code>4</code>, and
<code>B</code> has a size of <code>16</code>, such that <code>B</code> contains four <code>A</code>s that are contiguously
laid in memory.</p>
<p>However, a future Rust implementation could implement a layout optimization that
reduces the size of <code>A</code> to <code>3</code>. For the elements of <code>B</code> to be properly aligned,
<code>B</code> would need to choose a <code>stride == 4</code>, resulting in a <code>stride &gt; size</code>.</p>
<p>Guaranteeing <code>stride &gt;= size</code> is forward-compatible with such
layout-optimization proposals:</p>

<p>Rust currently exposes packed<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> SIMD vector types like <code>__m128</code> to users, but it
does not expose a way for users to construct their own vector types.</p>
<p>The set of currently-exposed packed SIMD vector types is
<em>implementation-defined</em> and it is currently different for each architecture.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p><em>packed</em> denotes that these SIMD vectors have a compile-time fixed size,
distinguishing these from SIMD vector types whose size is only known at
run-time. Rust currently only supports <em>packed</em> SIMD vector types. This is
elaborated further in <a href="https://github.com/gnzlbg/rfcs/blob/ppv/text/0000-ppv.md#interaction-with-cray-vectors">RFC2366</a>.</p>

<a class="header" href="#packed-simd-vector-types" id="packed-simd-vector-types"><h2>Packed SIMD vector types</h2></a>
<p>Packed SIMD vector types are <code>repr(simd)</code> homogeneous tuple-structs containing
<code>N</code> elements of type <code>T</code> where <code>N</code> is a power-of-two and the size and alignment
requirements of <code>T</code> are equal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[repr(simd)]
struct Vector&lt;T, N&gt;(T_0, ..., T_(N - 1));
</code></pre>
<p>The set of supported values of <code>T</code> and <code>N</code> is <em>implementation-defined</em>.</p>
<p>The size of <code>Vector</code> is <code>N * size_of::&lt;T&gt;()</code> and its alignment is an
<em>implementation-defined</em> function of <code>T</code> and <code>N</code> greater than or equal to
<code>align_of::&lt;T&gt;()</code>. That is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">assert_eq!(size_of::&lt;Vector&lt;T, N&gt;&gt;(), size_of::&lt;T&gt;() * N);
assert!(align_of::&lt;Vector&lt;T, N&gt;&gt;() &gt;= align_of::&lt;T&gt;());
</code></pre>
<p>That is, two distinct <code>repr(simd)</code> vector types that have the same <code>T</code> and the
same <code>N</code> have the same size and alignment.</p>
<p>Vector elements are laid out in source field order, enabling random access to
vector elements by reinterpreting the vector as an array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">union U {
   vec: Vector&lt;T, N&gt;,
   arr: [T; N]
}

assert_eq!(size_of::&lt;Vector&lt;T, N&gt;&gt;(), size_of::&lt;[T; N]&gt;());
assert!(align_of::&lt;Vector&lt;T, N&gt;&gt;() &gt;= align_of::&lt;[T; N]&gt;());

unsafe {
  let u = U { vec: Vector&lt;T, N&gt;(t_0, ..., t_(N - 1)) };

  assert_eq!(u.vec.0, u.arr[0]);
  // ... 
  assert_eq!(u.vec.(N - 1), u.arr[N - 1]);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Blocked</strong>: Should the layout of packed SIMD vectors be the same as that of
homogeneous tuples ? Such that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">union U {
  vec: Vector&lt;T, N&gt;,
  tup: (T_0, ..., T_(N-1)),
}

assert_eq!(size_of::&lt;Vector&lt;T, N&gt;&gt;(), size_of::&lt;(T_0, ..., T_(N-1))&gt;());

unsafe {
  let u = U { vec: Vector(t_0, ..., t_(N - 1)) };

  assert_eq!(u.vec.0, u.tup.0);
  // ... 
  assert_eq!(u.vec.(N - 1), u.tup.(N - 1));

<p>This is blocked on the resolution of issue <a href="https://github.com/rust-rfcs/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/36">#36</a> about the layout of
homogeneous structs and tuples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;</code> does not have the same <code>repr</code> as <code>T</code>, so
<code>MaybeUninit&lt;Vector&lt;T, N&gt;&gt;</code> are not <code>repr(simd)</code>, which has performance
consequences and means that <code>MaybeUninit&lt;Vector&lt;T, N&gt;&gt;</code> is not C-FFI safe.</p>
